The nearer\nthings were, moreover, the more her thoughts turned away from them.\nAll her immediate surroundings, the wearisome country, the middle-class\nimbeciles, the mediocrity of existence, seemed to her exceptional, a\npeculiar chance that had caught hold of her, while beyond stretched, as\nfar as eye could see, an immense land of joys and passions. She confused\nin her desire the sensualities of luxury with the delights of the heart,\nelegance of manners with delicacy of sentiment.

The pediment of the town hall had been hung with garlands\nof ivy; a tent had been erected in a meadow for the banquet; and in the\nmiddle of the Place, in front of the church, a kind of bombarde was\nto announce the arrival of the prefect and the names of the successful\nfarmers who had obtained prizes. The National Guard of Buchy (there was\nnone at Yonville) had come to join the corps of firemen, of whom Binet\nwas captain. On that day he wore a collar even higher than usual; and,\ntightly buttoned in his tunic, his figure was so stiff and motionless\nthat the whole vital portion of his person seemed to have descended into\nhis legs, which rose in a cadence of set steps with a single movement.\nAs there was some rivalry between the tax-collector and the colonel,\nboth, to show off their talents, drilled their men separately. One\nsaw the red epaulettes and the black breastplates pass and re-pass\nalternately; there was no end to it, and it constantly began again.\nThere had never been such a display of pomp. Several citizens had\nscoured their houses the evening before; tri-coloured flags hung from\nhalf-open windows; all the public-houses were full; and in the lovely\nweather the starched caps, the golden crosses, and the coloured\nneckerchiefs seemed whiter than snow, shone in the sun, and relieved\nwith the motley colours the sombre monotony of the frock-coats and blue\nsmocks. The neighbouring farmers’ wives, when they got off their horses,\npulled out the long pins that fastened around them their dresses, turned\nup for fear of mud; and the husbands, for their part, in order to save\ntheir hats, kept their handkerchiefs around them, holding one corner\nbetween their teeth.",
