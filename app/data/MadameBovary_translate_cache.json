  "Paris, more vague than the ocean, glimmered before Emma’s eyes in an\natmosphere of vermilion. The many lives that stirred amid this tumult\nwere, however, divided into parts, classed as distinct pictures. Emma\nperceived only two or three that hid from her all the rest, and in\nthemselves represented all humanity. The world of ambassadors moved over\npolished floors in drawing rooms lined with mirrors, round oval tables\ncovered with velvet and gold-fringed cloths. There were dresses with\ntrains, deep mysteries, anguish hidden beneath smiles. Then came the\nsociety of the duchesses; all were pale; all got up at four o’clock; the\nwomen, poor angels, wore English point on their petticoats; and the men,\nunappreciated geniuses under a frivolous outward seeming, rode horses to\ndeath at pleasure parties, spent the summer season at Baden, and towards\nthe forties married heiresses. In the private rooms of restaurants,\nwhere one sups after midnight by the light of wax candles, laughed the\nmotley crowd of men of letters and actresses. They were prodigal as\nkings, full of ideal, ambitious, fantastic frenzy. This was an existence\noutside that of all others, between heaven and earth, in the midst of\nstorms, having something of the sublime. For the rest of the world it\nwas lost, with no particular place and as if non-existent. The nearer\nthings were, moreover, the more her thoughts turned away from them.\nAll her immediate surroundings, the wearisome country, the middle-class\nimbeciles, the mediocrity of existence, seemed to her exceptional, a\npeculiar chance that had caught hold of her, while beyond stretched, as\nfar as eye could see, an immense land of joys and passions. She confused\nin her desire the sensualities of luxury with the delights of the heart,\nelegance of manners with delicacy of sentiment. Did not love, like\nIndian plants, need a special soil, a particular temperature? Signs\nby moonlight, long embraces, tears flowing over yielded hands, all\nthe fevers of the flesh and the languors of tenderness could not be\nseparated from the balconies of great castles full of indolence,\nfrom boudoirs with silken curtains and thick carpets, well-filled\nflower-stands, a bed on a raised dias, nor from the flashing of precious\nstones and the shoulder-knots of liveries.": {

Ah! you will find many prejudices to combat, Monsieur\nBovary, much obstinacy of routine, with which all the efforts of your\nscience will daily come into collision; for people still have recourse\nto novenas, to relics, to the priest, rather than come straight to the\ndoctor or the chemist. The climate, however, is not, truth to tell, bad,\nand we even have a few nonagenarians in our parish. The thermometer (I\nhave made some observations) falls in winter to 4 degrees Centigrade\nat the outside, which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum, or\notherwise 54 degrees Fahrenheit (English scale), not more. And, as a\nmatter of fact, we are sheltered from the north winds by the forest of\nArgueil on the one side, from the west winds by the St. Jean range on\nthe other; and this heat, moreover, which, on account of the aqueous\nvapours given off by the river and the considerable number of cattle\nin the fields, which, as you know, exhale much ammonia, that is to say,\nnitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen (no, nitrogen and hydrogen alone), and\nwhich sucking up into itself the humus from the ground, mixing together\nall those different emanations, unites them into a stack, so to say,\nand combining with the electricity diffused through the atmosphere, when\nthere is any, might in the long run, as in tropical countries, engender\ninsalubrious miasmata--this heat, I say, finds itself perfectly tempered\non the side whence it comes, or rather whence it should come--that is to\nsay, the southern side--by the south-eastern winds, which, having cooled\nthemselves passing over the Seine, reach us sometimes all at once like\nbreezes from Russia.”": {

Several citizens had\nscoured their houses the evening before; tri-coloured flags hung from\nhalf-open windows; all the public-houses were full; and in the lovely\nweather the starched caps, the golden crosses, and the coloured\nneckerchiefs seemed whiter than snow, shone in the sun, and relieved\nwith the motley colours the sombre monotony of the frock-coats and blue\nsmocks.

Thus the praise\nof the Government took up less space in it; religion and agriculture\nmore. He showed in it the relations of these two, and how they had\nalways contributed to civilisation. Rodolphe with Madame Bovary was\ntalking dreams, presentiments, magnetism. Going back to the cradle of\nsociety, the orator painted those fierce times when men lived on acorns\nin the heart of woods. Then they had left off the skins of beasts, had\nput on cloth, tilled the soil, planted the vine. Was this a good, and\nin this discovery was there not more of injury than of gain? Monsieur\nDerozerays set himself this problem. From magnetism little by little\nRodolphe had come to affinities, and while the president was citing\nCincinnatus and his plough, Diocletian, planting his cabbages, and the\nEmperors of China inaugurating the year by the sowing of seed, the\nyoung man was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible\nattractions find their cause in some previous state of existence.": {

But in making this movement, as she leant\nback in her chair, she saw in the distance, right on the line of the\nhorizon, the old diligence, the “Hirondelle,” that was slowly descending\nthe hill of Leux, dragging after it a long trail of dust. It was in this\nyellow carriage that Léon had so often come back to her, and by this\nroute down there that he had gone for ever.

  "To get back something of her, he fetched from the cupboard at the\nbedside an old Rheims biscuit-box, in which he usually kept his letters\nfrom women, and from it came an odour of dry dust and withered\nroses. First he saw a handkerchief with pale little spots. It was a\nhandkerchief of hers. Once when they were walking her nose had bled; he\nhad forgotten it. Near it, chipped at all the corners, was a miniature\ngiven him by Emma: her toilette seemed to him pretentious, and her\nlanguishing look in the worst possible taste. Then, from looking at this\nimage and recalling the memory of its original, Emma’s features little\nby little grew confused in his remembrance, as if the living and the\npainted face, rubbing one against the other, had effaced each other.\nFinally, he read some of her letters; they were full of explanations\nrelating to their journey, short, technical, and urgent, like business\nnotes. He wanted to see the long ones again, those of old times. In\norder to find them at the bottom of the box, Rodolphe disturbed all the\nothers, and mechanically began rummaging amidst this mass of papers and\nthings, finding pell-mell bouquets, garters, a black mask, pins, and\nhair--hair! dark and fair, some even, catching in the hinges of the box,\nbroke when it was opened.": {

  "To begin with, he did not know how he could pay Monsieur Homais for all\nthe physic supplied by him, and though, as a medical man, he was not\nobliged to pay for it, he nevertheless blushed a little at such an\nobligation. Then the expenses of the household, now that the servant was\nmistress, became terrible. Bills rained in upon the house; the tradesmen\ngrumbled; Monsieur Lheureux especially harassed him. In fact, at\nthe height of Emma’s illness, the latter, taking advantage of the\ncircumstances to make his bill larger, had hurriedly brought the cloak,\nthe travelling-bag, two trunks instead of one, and a number of other\nthings. It was very well for Charles to say he did not want them. The\ntradesman answered arrogantly that these articles had been ordered, and\nthat he would not take them back; besides, it would vex madame in her\nconvalescence; the doctor had better think it over; in short, he was\nresolved to sue him rather than give up his rights and take back his\ngoods. Charles subsequently ordered them to be sent back to the shop.\nFélicité forgot; he had other things to attend to; then thought no more\nabout them. Monsieur Lheureux returned to the charge, and, by turns\nthreatening and whining, so managed that Bovary ended by signing a\nbill at six months. But hardly had he signed this bill than a bold idea\noccurred to him: it was to borrow a thousand francs from Lheureux.\nSo, with an embarrassed air, he asked if it were possible to get them,\nadding that it would be for a year, at any interest he wished. Lheureux\nran off to his shop, brought back the money, and dictated another bill,\nby which Bovary undertook to pay to his order on the 1st of September\nnext the sum of one thousand and seventy francs, which, with the hundred\nand eighty already agreed to, made just twelve hundred and fifty, thus\nlending at six per cent in addition to one-fourth for commission: and\nthe things bringing him in a good third at the least, this ought in\ntwelve months to give him a profit of a hundred and thirty francs. He\nhoped that the business would not stop there; that the bills would not\nbe paid; that they would be renewed; and that his poor little money,\nhaving thriven at the doctor’s as at a hospital, would come back to him\none day considerably more plump, and fat enough to burst his bag.": {
