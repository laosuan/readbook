The many lives that stirred amid this tumult\nwere, however, divided into parts, classed as distinct pictures. Emma\nperceived only two or three that hid from her all the rest, and in\nthemselves represented all humanity. The world of ambassadors moved over\npolished floors in drawing rooms lined with mirrors, round oval tables\ncovered with velvet and gold-fringed cloths. There were dresses with\ntrains, deep mysteries, anguish hidden beneath smiles. Then came the\nsociety of the duchesses; all were pale; all got up at four o’clock; the\nwomen, poor angels, wore English point on their petticoats; and the men,\nunappreciated geniuses under a frivolous outward seeming, rode horses to\ndeath at pleasure parties, spent the summer season at Baden, and towards\nthe forties married heiresses. In the private rooms of restaurants,\nwhere one sups after midnight by the light of wax candles, laughed the\nmotley crowd of men of letters and actresses. They were prodigal as\nkings, full of ideal, ambitious, fantastic frenzy. This was an existence\noutside that of all others, between heaven and earth, in the midst of\nstorms, having something of the sublime. For the rest of the world it\nwas lost, with no particular place and as if non-existent. The nearer\nthings were, moreover, the more her thoughts turned away from them.\nAll her immediate surroundings, the wearisome country, the middle-class\nimbeciles, the mediocrity of existence, seemed to her exceptional, a\npeculiar chance that had caught hold of her, while beyond stretched, as\nfar as eye could see, an immense land of joys and passions. She confused\nin her desire the sensualities of luxury with the delights of the heart,\nelegance of manners with delicacy of sentiment. Did not love, like\nIndian plants, need a special soil, a particular temperature? Signs\nby moonlight, long embraces, tears flowing over yielded hands, all\nthe fevers of the flesh and the languors of tenderness could not be\nseparated from the balconies of great castles full of indolence,\nfrom boudoirs with silken curtains and thick carpets, well-filled\nflower-stands, a bed on a raised dias, nor from the flashing of precious\nstones and the shoulder-knots of liveries.",

The climate, however, is not, truth to tell, bad,\nand we even have a few nonagenarians in our parish. The thermometer (I\nhave made some observations) falls in winter to 4 degrees Centigrade\nat the outside, which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum, or\notherwise 54 degrees Fahrenheit (English scale), not more.

Then the expenses of the household, now that the servant was\nmistress, became terrible. Bills rained in upon the house; the tradesmen\ngrumbled; Monsieur Lheureux especially harassed him. In fact, at\nthe height of Emma’s illness, the latter, taking advantage of the\ncircumstances to make his bill larger, had hurriedly brought the cloak,\nthe travelling-bag, two trunks instead of one, and a number of other\nthings. It was very well for Charles to say he did not want them. The\ntradesman answered arrogantly that these articles had been ordered, and\nthat he would not take them back; besides, it would vex madame in her\nconvalescence; the doctor had better think it over; in short, he was\nresolved to sue him rather than give up his rights and take back his\ngoods. Charles subsequently ordered them to be sent back to the shop.\nFélicité forgot; he had other things to attend to; then thought no more\nabout them. Monsieur Lheureux returned to the charge, and, by turns\nthreatening and whining, so managed that Bovary ended by signing a\nbill at six months. But hardly had he signed this bill than a bold idea\noccurred to him: it was to borrow a thousand francs from Lheureux.\nSo, with an embarrassed air, he asked if it were possible to get them,\nadding that it would be for a year, at any interest he wished. Lheureux\nran off to his shop, brought back the money, and dictated another bill,\nby which Bovary undertook to pay to his order on the 1st of September\nnext the sum of one thousand and seventy francs, which, with the hundred\nand eighty already agreed to, made just twelve hundred and fifty, thus\nlending at six per cent in addition to one-fourth for commission: and\nthe things bringing him in a good third at the least, this ought in\ntwelve months to give him a profit of a hundred and thirty francs. He\nhoped that the business would not stop there; that the bills would not\nbe paid; that they would be renewed; and that his poor little money,\nhaving thriven at the doctor’s as at a hospital, would come back to him\none day considerably more plump, and fat enough to burst his bag.",
